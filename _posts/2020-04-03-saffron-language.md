### Language editing

We follow a four-step process to ensure that you receive a manuscript that retains the original meaning and is ready to submit to a journal.

* **Step 1** A translator converts the manuscript into English, focusing on the technical language and subject-area conventions.
* **Step 2** A bilingual expert checks the accuracy of the translation and ensures that your original meaning is conveyed.
* **Step 3** An experienced reviewer checks for punctuation, grammar, language style, formatting, clarity, and fluency.
* **Step 4** A senior reviewer checks that all your requirements have been met before sending you the final, submission-ready file.

### Graphic illustration
In addition to language editing, our illustrators can provide graphic illustration for your manuscript. The right illustrations will bring your project to life, whether you need an Illustration for a book, logo, web design, animation or print media.
