  <li><strong>Step 2</strong> A bilingual expert checks the accuracy of the translation and ensures that your original meaning is conveyed.</li>
  <li><strong>Step 3</strong> An experienced reviewer checks for punctuation, grammar, language style, formatting, clarity, and fluency.</li>
  <li>Support for a wide gamut of HTML elements</li>
  <li>Related posts (time-based, because Jekyll) below each post</li>
  <li>Syntax highlighting, courtesy Pygments (the Python-based code snippet highlighter)</li>
</ul>
